# One app for all your furry friend's needs

## About this app

Dog owners are busy, but deeply care about their dogs. Currently, there is no well-known systematic way for dog owners to keep track of their dog's needs. 

From juggling between keeping track of all of your dog’s health records through tons of spreadsheets to setting up meetups with other dogs and owners, our app hopes to bridge the gap and simplify the average dog owner’s life. 

Through our user-friendly interface, we strive to become the go-to platform for dog owners seeking a systematic way to improve and alleviate dog’s lives and owner’s stress with these key features on the app:
- Health: systematically store medical records
- Community: connecting other dog owners to each other promoting socialization
- On-Demand Help: Q&A regarding dog needs with  GenAI
